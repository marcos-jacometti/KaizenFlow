                        <span>
                            Kaizen Blitz: Also known as a Rapid Improvement Event, a Kaizen Blitz is a short-term, focused initiative typically lasting from a few days to a week. It targets a specific problem or opportunity within an organization with the goal of implementing quick, impactful improvements.
                            <br /><br />
                            Kaizen Events: Similar to Kaizen Blitz, Kaizen Events are structured improvement activities that span a longer duration, often a few weeks or months. They are comprehensive in scope and involve more extensive planning, analysis, and implementation of changes across processes or departments.
                        </span>
                        <h4>Key Characteristics and Benefits</h4>
